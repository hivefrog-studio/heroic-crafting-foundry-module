# Heroic Crafting

This module incorporates the contents of the Heroic Crafting Â© 2022 Hive Frog Studio Pathfinder Infinite Splatbook. If you somehow encounter this module without a copy of this splatbook, it can be purchased [here](https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/389992/Heroic-Crafting?src=FoundryModule). It's pay what you decide, so you really have no excuse.

Once enabled, this module will add 5 compendiums:
- Actions
- Feats
- Items
- Tables
- Vehicles


All of them pretty much do what it says on the tin.

## Known Issues
This module requires a bit of bookkeeping from both GMs and players.
- Most DCs vary by applicable item and are not set. We recommend players use the integrated roll nonetheless, but it is far from optimized.
- Because of the variable DCs and the nature of Heroic Crafting as a whole, looking up success values in tables is a necessity at this point in time. We have provided these tables in their entirety, linked from all appropriate feats and actions.
- Unfinished projects are not a specific item type, and therefore must be tracked in the player's inventory or a journal entry.

- Material troves are not a specific item type, and therefore must be tracked in the player's inventory or a journal entry.

## Manual Installation (since I have no idea when HiveFrog will/might accept a PR from this fork)
- Download this repository's code as a zip file
- Extract the contents to your modules folder
- Rename folder from "heroic-crafting-foundry-moidule" to "heroic-crafting"
